**`x-`** is a toolkit for building static websites with reusable components and simple Markdown rendering. Designed to 
be a natural extension of HTML, it can be used to quickly prototype a site and get it off the ground, or it can be 
progressively integrated into an existing project with zero configuration. Using the command line tool, 
everything is compiled to standard HTML, ready to be published.

---

### Components
Components are created with a standard HTML file in the `components` directory. Properties are defined with a basic 
template syntax:

```html
<!-- components/greeting.html -->

<h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
```

Components can then be used throughout a project with the `<x-component>` element, which should include a `src` 
attribute with the component's name â€• the path to the `components` directory and `.html` extension 
are implied. Property values are declared via additional attributes:

```html
<x-component src="greeting" name="world">
```

Components can also contain child content. The `<x-slot>` element is used to specify where content should be injected:

```html
<!-- components/base-layout.html -->

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <x-slot />
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

At build time, the `<x-slot>` element is replaced with any content inside the `<x-component>` element:

```html
<x-component src="base-layout" title="Home">
  <h1>Home</h1>
  <p>Page content...</p>
</x-component>
```

The `<x-slot>` element can contain optional fallback content that will be used if no child content for a component 
is provided:

```html
<x-slot>Default content...</slot>
```

### Content
Markdown content can easily be added to a page with the `<x-content>` element. The `src` attribute is used to specify a 
Markdown file in the `content` directory. Similar to the `src` attribute for the `<x-component>` element, the path to 
the `content` directory and `.md` extension are implied:

```html
<x-content src="introduction" />
```

### Directory structure
**`x-`** relies on a simple directory structure in order to find your projects views, components, and content. This is 
done so that `src` attribute for the `<x-component>` and `<x-content>` elements can simply include the name of a file 
instead of a messy path that may change depending on where the element is used.

**`views`:** Contains HTML files for the pages that will be compiled and output to `public`

**`components`:** Contains HTML files for the components that will be used with the `<x-component>` element

**`content`:** Contains Markdown files that will be used with the `<x-content>` element

By default, **`x-`** looks for these directories in the current working directory. However, a custom path can be specified 
with the `--root` CLI option.

### CLI
To get started, simply use the `x-` command to process and compile your project. See `x- --help` for 
additional options:

```
$ x- --help

Usage: x- [options]

Options:

  -r, --root          Specify path where `views`, `components`, and `content` can be found

  -o, --output        Specify output path for compiled views

  -v, --version       Displays the current version

```

### Installation
To install **`x-`** locally (recommended):

```
$ npm install --save-dev x-
```

To install **`x-`** globally:

```
$ npm install --global x-
```

Alternatively, **`x-`** can be used without installing via `npx`:

```
$ npx x- [options]
```
